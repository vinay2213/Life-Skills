# Good Practices for Software Development


## Question 1

**Which point(s) were new to you?**

- Getting frequent feedback so that you are on track and everyone is on the same page
- Use the group chat/channels to communicate most of the time. This is preferable over private DMs simply because there are more eyes on the main channel.
- Make time for your company, the product you are working on and your team members. This will help a lot in improving your communication with the team.



## Question 2

**Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?**

- Improving focus by setting clear goals and minimizing distractions.
- Communicate with team members.
- Blocking notifications of social apps during working hours.
