# Tiny Habits


## Question 1

**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

The most interesting idea in the video was committing to reading just one page of a book each day. It's a small and achievable task that can be done in just a minute or two. Over time, it can lead to reading more than one page.

## Question 2

**How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.**

In BJ Fogg's Tiny Habits method, "B = MAP" stands for Behavior equals Motivation, Ability and Prompt.

M (Motivation): This is about how much you want to do a certain behavior. To make a habit easier, you can link it to something you already enjoy or feel motivated to do.

A (Ability): Ability is about how easy or hard it is to do a behavior. To make a habit easier, you can make the behavior less difficult or complicated.

P (Prompt): A prompt is like a reminder that initiates a behavior. To make a habit easier, you can make this reminder more noticeable in your environment.

## Question 3

**Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)**

Celebrating after completing a habit is crucial because it reinforces the habit. When you connect a positive feeling to finishing a habit, it strengthens the pathways in your brain associated with that habit. This makes it more likely to stick around. Even small celebrations give you a sense of accomplishment, making the habit more appealing and easier to maintain.

## Question 4

**In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?**

The most intriguing idea in the video was that making small changes in daily habits can lead to a very different life outcome.

## Question 5

**What is the book's perspective about Identity?**

In James Clear's book "Atomic Habits," the focus is on changing your identity to make lasting habit changes. Instead of just trying to do something new, you should aim to become the kind of person who naturally engages in that habit. It's about changing who you are at your core.

## Question 6

**Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?**

To make a habit easier, "Atomic Habits" suggests making it obvious, attractive, and easy. This means setting clear cues (making it obvious), finding ways to make the habit enjoyable (making it attractive), and reducing the effort needed to do the habit (making it easy).

## Question 7

**Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?**

To make a habit harder to do, the book recommends making it invisible, unattractive and difficult. You can do this by removing or hiding cues for the habit (making it invisible), associating negative consequences with the habit (making it unattractive), and adding obstacles or effort to perform the habit (making it difficult).

## Question 8

**Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?**

If you want to exercise more, you can make the cue obvious by placing your workout clothes where you'll see them. Make it attractive by choosing exercises you enjoy, like dancing or swimming. Make it easy by setting a specific schedule and having a workout partner for motivation. Finally, make it satisfying by rewarding yourself with something you like after each workout, like a healthy smoothie.

## Question 9

**Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?**

If you want to cut down on snacking, make the cue invisible by removing snacks from your sight or keeping them out of reach. Make the process unattractive by finding healthier alternatives to the snacks you want to avoid. Make it hard by creating obstacles, like keeping the snacks in a hard-to-reach place. Make the response unsatisfying by reminding yourself of the negative health effects of over-snacking.
